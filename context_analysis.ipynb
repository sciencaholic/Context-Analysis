    "\n",
    "`TfidfVectorizer` is used to compute the word counts or term frequency (TF), inverse document frequency (IDF), and the product of the two, TF-IDF values, all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Term Frequency (TF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Term Frequency (TF) gives us the frequency of the word in each document in the corpus. It is defined as the ratio of the number of times the word appears in a document compared to the total number of words in that document. The formula for TF is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF}(word) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times the word appears in a document}}{\\text{Total number of words in the document}} = tf_{i,j} = \\frac{n_{i,j}}{\\sum_k n_{i,j}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "TF increases as the number of occurrences of that word within the document increases, summarizing how often a given word appears within a document. Each document has its own TF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is used to calculate the weight of rare words across all documents in the corpus, thus downscales words that appear a lot across documents. The formula for IDF is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{IDF}(word) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{Total number of documents}}{\\text{Number of documents containing the word}}\\right) = idf(w) = \\log\\left(\\frac{N}{df_t}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower the IDF value of a word, the less unique it is to any particular document. Words that occur rarely in the corpus have a high IDF score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF-IDF Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF values are the product of TF and IDF values and highlight the words that are more interesting, i.e., frequent in a document but not across documents. The formula for calculating TF-IDF is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF-IDF}(word) = \\text{TF}(word) \\times \\text{IDF}(word) = w_{i,j} = tf_{i,j} \\times \\log\\left(\\frac{N}{df_i}\\right)\n",

    "- \\( df_i \\) is the document frequency, the number of documents containing term \\( i \\),\n",
    "- \\( N \\) is the total number of documents in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "`TfidfVectorizer` tokenizes documents, learns the vocabulary and inverse document frequency weightings, and allows encoding new documents. This emphasizes words that are more relevant to a specific document in the corpus, providing a way to extract meaningful words from texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In simple terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Term Frequency (TF) is like counting how many times each highlighted word appears in an article to understand its importance in that specific context.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) helps to reduce the weight of words that appear too frequently across all articles, making common words less dominant in the analysis.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Combining TF and IDF gives a score that helps to identify words that are important in an individual article but not just commonly used across all articles.    \n",
    "\n",
    "By sorting words in each article based on their TF-IDF scores, the most defining terms of each article are identified, giving a quick glance at what the article is likely about."

    "LDA is a tool for topic modeling rather than document categorization. It assumes that a document is a mixture of topics, and a topic is a mixture of words.

Each topic is characterized by a distribution of words that are likely to be found together.    \n",

    "\n",
    "Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a linear-algebraic model that reduces the dimensionality of a vector for simpler representation. This method is particularly useful when there are many ambiguous features or if the features have weak predictability. The workings of NMF are explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an original matrix \\( A \\), we can obtain two matrices \\( W \\) and \\( H \\), such that \\( A = WH \\). NMF has an inherent clustering property, such that \\( W \\) and \\( H \\) represent the following information about \\( A \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( A \\) (Document-word matrix) - input that contains which words appear in which documents.\n",
    "- \\( W \\) (Basis vectors) - the topics (clusters) discovered from the documents.\n",
    "- \\( H \\) (Coefficient matrix) - the membership weights for the topics in each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate \\( W \\) and \\( H \\) by optimizing over an objective function (like the EM algorithm), updating both \\( W \\) and \\( H \\) iteratively until convergence.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this function:\n",
    "- ( $\\| A - WH \\|_F^2$ ) represents the Frobenius norm of the matrix difference between A and the product WH, squared.\n",
    "- A is the original non-negative matrix we want to decompose.\n",
    "- W and H are the matrices we're solving for, representing the basis and coefficient matrices, respectively.\n",
    "- n and m are the dimensions of A, with i indexing rows and j indexing columns.\n",
    "- ( $A_{ij}$ ) is the element of matrix A at row i and column j.\n",
    "- ( $(WH)_{ij}$ ) is the element of the product matrix WH at row i and column j.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the objective function for NMF, we measure the error of reconstruction between \\( A \\) and the product of its \n",
    "factors \\( W \\) and \\( H \\), based on Euclidean Distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W_{ic} \\leftarrow W_{ic} \\frac{(AH)_{ic}}{(WHH)_{ic}}\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the objective function, the update rules for W and H can be derived. The updated values are calculated in parallel operations, and using the new W and H, we re-calculate the reconstruction error, repeating this process until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Simpler Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "NMF starts by looking for patterns in the usage of words across all the articles. It tries to figure out if certain words often appear together, which might suggest they are part of a common topic. For instance, words like \"election,\" \"vote,\" and \"campaign\" often appear together and might form a \"Politics\" topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then makes a list of topics (though it doesn't know what to call them yet) based on these patterns. Each topic is a mix of words with certain weights. In the \"Politics\" topic, words like \"election\" might have a high weight, while unrelated words like \"tennis\" would have a very low or zero weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, NMF takes each article and breaks it down into a mix of these topics. It figures out that an article might be mostly about \"Politics,\" but also has a bit of \"Economy\" and \"International Relations\" in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of NMF is to be able to recreate each article from the list of topics it has created. It does this by combining the topics in different proportions. NMF keeps adjusting the weights of words in topics and the mix of topics in articles until the recreated articles are as close as possible to the original ones."

    "## Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) or Latent Semantic Index (LSI)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In LSA, also known as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), we start by creating a document-term matrix A of size ( m x n ), where m is the number of documents and n is the number of words in the vocabulary. This matrix is typically very sparse, meaning that a lot of the values in the matrix are zero, and noisy, which indicates the presence of less informative variations in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality Reduction with Truncated SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the sparsity and noise, we apply dimensionality reduction, specifically using truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD decomposes the matrix A into three distinct matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = U \\cdot S \\cdot V^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- S is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of A. These values are arranged in descending order, and they represent the importance or 'strength' of each latent semantic factor.\n",
    "- U is the document-topic matrix with each row representing a document as a combination of topics.\n",
    "- $V^T$ (the transpose of V is the term-topic matrix, with each row representing a term as a combination of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of the Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "- The singular values in S give us insight into the structure of our data. By selecting a subset of the largest singular values and their corresponding vectors in U and V, we can approximate the original matrix A with a lower-dimensional representation.\n",
    "- The matrices U and $V^T$ provide a new way to look at the documents and terms, respectively. Instead of seeing them in the high-dimensional space of terms or documents, they are now viewed in the lower-dimensional space of topics, which can be more informative and less redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, LSA using truncated SVD helps to uncover the latent thematic structures in the text data, thereby improving the efficiency of information retrieval, text mining, and other natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In simple terms\n",
    "\n",
    "LSA looks at all the words on the articles and counts how often each word appears in each article. Then, it starts to analyze these to find patterns. For example, if the word \"apple\" often appears with words like \"pie\", \"crust\", and \"bake,\" it might decide that these words are part of a \"Baking\" topic. It does this for all the words, grouping them into topics based on how often they appear together across different articles. It removes the less helpful words and simplifies the topics, making it easier to see the major themes.\n",

    "The Jaccard similarity measures the similarity between two sets of data to see which members are shared and distinct. The Jaccard similarity is calculated by dividing the number of observations in both sets by the number of observations in either set. In other words, the Jaccard similarity can be computed as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two sets. This can be written in set notation using intersection $(A \\cap B$) and unions $(A \\cup B)$ of two sets:\n",

The Jaccard Similarity will be 0 if the two sets don't share any values and 1 if the two sets are identical. The set may contain either numerical values or strings.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{similarity} = \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{\\|A\\|\\|B\\|} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i B_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i^2}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",

    "- $A_i$ and $B_i$ are the components of vectors A and B respectively.\n",

    "This metric is particularly useful in various applications such as text analysis and information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate cosine similarity, sentences need to be converted into vectors. This can be done using the bag of words model with either TF (term frequency) or TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency). TF is suitable for general text similarity, while TF-IDF is beneficial for search query relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the TF-IDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, offset by the frequency of the word across the dataset. The calculated TF-IDF values are then normalized by the Euclidean norm to ensure that each row vector has a length of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting normalized TF-IDF matrix should have the shape of ( n x m ). A cosine similarity matrix ( n x n ) can then be obtained by multiplying the TF-IDF matrix by its transpose ( m x n )."
